menu: The Research Bazaar is a (free-of-charge) 3-day intensive conference where researchers come together to up-skill in ‘next generation digital research tools and skills’. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!<br><br> Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along! <br><br> NOTE! The New Zealand events (Auckland and Dunedin) are being held <strong>2-4 Feb</strong>, not 1-3 Feb as elsewhere in the world.<br><br> We are still working on the programme to bring you a broad range of digital research skills topics but you should <a href='#registerSection'>register</a> now to avoid missing out. Below are just some of the sessions that will be on offer. <br><br> 

accommodation: Coming to the Dunedin ResBaz event from out of town?<BR>Dunedin has a multitude of accommodation options to suit all tastes and budgets. <BR>If you need advice please email <a href="mailto:res.baz@otago.ac.nz">res.baz@otago.ac.nz</a> and we will endeavour to help.

 - class: Main Streams - Software Carpentry
   tools:
    - name: The Unix Shell
      id: id1
      blurb: Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including “high-performance computing” supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.
    - name: R
      id: id2
      blurb: The R language provides a flexible and powerful environment for data analysis and visualisation.  This workshop will introduce the R language and will teach you some key programming skills.

      blurb: The Python language is a popular versatile programming langauge praised for it's readability and <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonPhilosophy'>design philosophy</a>
    - name: Git
      id: idn
      blurb: Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world - it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on.
 - class: Additional Sessions
   tools:
    - name: ggplot2 for data visualisation
      id: id3
      blurb: The popular ggplot2 package for R provides a powerful means to create compelling data visualisations.  Come along and learn how to use ggplot2 to make your data look even more beautiful.
    - name: data manipulation in R
      id: idb
      blurb: Using Hadley Wickham's tidyr, reshape, and dplyr packages to manipulate data. 
    - name: Reproducible research - concepts and practise
      id: id4
      blurb: Reproducibility is a key component of  science, and one that is becoming even more critical as we analyse ever-growing amounts of data using increasingly complex tools.  Come along to learn about the key concepts of reproducible research, and gain some experience with tools that will help you put these ideas into practise. 
    - name: Analysis workflows for genomic data from ancient DNA
      id: ido
      blurb: Having trouble analysing the genomic data from your ancient DNA study?  Then this workshop is for you!
    - name: Interactive data analysis and visualisation with R and shiny server
      id: id9
      blurb: Want to turn your ground-breaking R analyses into web-based tools for your friends and collaborators?  The "shiny" package for R provides a simple mechanism for building sophisticated web interfaces for interactive data analysis and visualisation - come along and learn how it's done.
    - name: Advice for early career researchers
      id: id8
      blurb: Want to get your research career off to a flying start? Come along and learn from the pros. 
    - name: Advanced R programming
      id: id7
      blurb: Can't get enough of R?  This focused workshop will help turn your commands into scripts, your scripts into functions, and your functions into packages - what more could you want? 
    - name: How do I use this? 
      id: idy
      blurb: Domain-specfic tools and extensions will be offered depending on community interest and availability of instructors (data carpentry instructor training in progress). Suggestions for or offers of domain expertise welcome in areas including life sciences, physical sciences, digital humanities, economics or finance.
    - name: High Performance Computing with  NeSI
      id: idz
      blurb: The <a href='http://nesi.org.nz/'>New Zealand eScience Infrastructure</a> have been a crucial to the development of this conference. They also offer High-Performance Computing resources to institutions across the country. Here we'll show you how to sign up and use their facilities to extend the skills covered in our workshops. Besides, Supercomputers are cool.
    - name: HackyHour and Projects
      id: ida
      blurb: Want to put your newfound digital toolkit to the test? Come along to HackyHour and our experts will help you troubleshoot any problems you have. If we can fix it, we'll probably know someone who can. On the last day you can attempt a mini-Project of your own so if you come up with a problem in your field that you think programming could help with come along and we'll get you started. We're also encouraging you to take these skills home with you and start The <a href='https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/en/faculty/about/news-and-events/events/2015/3/26/hacky-hour-.html'>HackyHour</a> or The <a href='https://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupHandbook/'>Mozilla Study Group</a> of your own to help each other.

Conforming to university or journal formatting standards ca be a thing of past. Download their template and you're off.

schedule: Each day at ResBaz will be split into morning and afternoon events. Following a Key Story from one of our exciting speakers, the mornings will consist of introductory <a href='https://software-carpentry.org/'>Software Carpentry</a> lessons, alongside intermediate and advanced topics for those who are already familar with the introductory material. Afternoon sessions will begin with a second Key Story, followed by a more informal collection of activities, including focussed workshops, dicussion sessions, and lightning research presentations.  At the end of each afternoon we will reconvence for a discusion session, to help set the scene for an evening of fun social and networking activities. <br><br>A more detailed timetable will be displayed once more sessions are confirmed.<br><br>
